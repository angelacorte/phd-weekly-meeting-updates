## Period abroad infos/iter

- If I already know the period, I have to send the _request form to Bartolini and then to AFORM_.
- The Marco Polo program is a separate thing — first, I need authorization from the others.
- In Bartolini’s document, I have to _summarize in about 4 lines what I will do during the period abroad_, then she approves it.
- At that point, I have to _fill out the form_ available on the university intranet for PhD student mobility abroad and also the one that entitles me to the _50% scholarship increase_; once this is authorized, everything is set.
- When the Marco Polo call opens (**usually in December**), I need to _write a project proposal_ and complete the procedure on the website to apply for the call.
- When I come back, I have to write a _final project report_ to attach to the Marco Polo call documents, and then fill in the return form to be sent to AFORM.
