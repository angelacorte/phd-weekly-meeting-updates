# Week 01 -- 10 October 2025

### Tasks and short-term goals

1. Publish _Field VMC_ journal (deadline: undefined, priority: high, *waiting for editor to send further info*)
2. Study _CLF-CBF-QP_ for period abroad (deadline: ASAP, priority: high, *in progress*)
3. Implementation of _time replication_ in Collektive—necessary for self-stabilizing Gossip validation
   (deadline: undefined, priority: medium, *shared Clock done with tests*)
4. _Period abroad iter and proposal_ (deadline: undefined, priority: high, *call for application not published yet AFAIK*)

### Medium-term goals

1. _Collektive journal_: venue and contribute to define yet (priority: medium-high)
2. Paper on _Self-Stabilizing Gossip_, initial possible venues: SEAMS, others to define 
    (deadline: undefined, priority: medium, current status: draft paper done for PhD course—missing evaluation due to previous point [1.3])

### Long-term goals

1. Implementation of _aggregate processes_ in Collektive (related to [1.2])
2. Implementation of _signals and interrupts_ in Collektive (related to [1.2])
3. Implementation of _users and permissions_ in Collektive

## Period abroad infos/iter

- If I already know the period, I have to send the _request form to Bartolini and then to AFORM_.
- The Marco Polo program is a separate thing — first, I need authorization from the others.
- In Bartolini’s document, I have to _summarize in about 4 lines what I will do during the period abroad_, then she approves it.
- At that point, I have to _fill out the form_ available on the university intranet for PhD student mobility abroad and also the one that entitles me to the _50% scholarship increase_; once this is authorized, everything is set.
- When the Marco Polo call opens (**usually in December**), I need to _write a project proposal_ and complete the procedure on the website to apply for the call.
- When I come back, I have to write a _final project report_ to attach to the Marco Polo call documents, and then fill in the return form to be sent to AFORM.
